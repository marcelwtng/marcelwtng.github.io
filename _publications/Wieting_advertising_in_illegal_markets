excerpt: 'This thesis analyzes how operators in the Dutch market for online gambling advertise online-in light of its illegal status. Although online advertisement may be subject to prosecution, I find that some operators do advertise on a larger scale by advertising on websites with little popularity. Some operators even appear to rely on malicious adware. Using Panel Data Regressions and Vector-Autoregression, I find this strategy to be ineffective in terms of inducing website visits. In contrast to the ineffective display ads, I find strong effects for e-mail and social media.'
