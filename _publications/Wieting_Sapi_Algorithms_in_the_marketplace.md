We analyze algorithmic pricing on Bol.com, the largest online marketplace in the Netherlands and Belgium. Based on more than two months of pricing data for around 2,800 popular products, we find an inverted-U shaped relationship between the price of the Buy Box (the most prominently displayed offer for a product) and algorithmic competition. We are first to document that the presence of algorithmic sellers in monopoly markets goes hand-in-hand with lower prices. We explain this by the inability of traditional product managers to manually adjust prices product-by-product for a large number of items, which automated agents may correct. Consistently with collusion, algorithms benefit from each otherâ€™s presence: Prices are particularly high if two algorithms bid against each other and there is a medium number of sellers in the market. With a sufficient number of competitors, algorithmic sellers reduce the Buy Box price and compete particularly fiercely. We also identify several algorithmic pricing patterns that are often associated with collusion. Such patterns may serve as valuable screens for anti-competitive practices. Algorithmic sellers are more likely to win the Buy Box, and therefore carry disproportionate relevance for consumers and welfare. Overall, our findings call for careful policy with respect to pricing algorithms, that considers both the risk of collusion and the need to preserve potential efficiencies.
